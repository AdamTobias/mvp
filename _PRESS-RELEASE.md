There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##

  Quick Draw

## Sub-Heading ##

  Draw simple pictures simply!

## Summary ##

  This product allows the user to create digital artwork from scratch.  By simply selecting tools and clicking/dragging the mouse, graphics will appear on the page as the user builds a work of art.  Users may save and load past work.

## Problem ##

  Computer users often have a desire to generate graphics cheaply and quickly -- perhaps to make a sign, or for teaching purposes, or for entertainment.  While professional grade art is sometimes required, often a quick and dirty graphic is sufficient.  Users do not want to spend a lot of time up-front in learning how to use drawing software and navigating a complex interface.  

## Solution ##
  
  Quick Draw is lightweight, efficient, minimalist drawing app that allows users to begin creating their graphics immediately.  An intuitive interface makes for a non-existent learning curve.

## Quote from You ##
 
  I just want to draw some lines, not paint the Mona Lisa!

## How to Get Started ##
  
  Simply load the app and get drawing.  The default pencil tool allows for simple lines, while other tools may be selected to help produce the desired graphics.  

## Customer Quote ##
  
  Quick Draw helped turn my funny mental image into a hilarious email attachment in just 2 minutes!

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  
  Ask Adam Grimm for the source files so you can get drawing today!
